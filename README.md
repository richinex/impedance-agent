# Impedance Agent

The analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data involves basically three stages/steps

- Check for data quality or KK using tools such as Boukamp's linKK
- Fit of an equivalent circuit model (ECM) model to the data by means of complex non-linear least squares (CNLS)
- Analysis of the distribution of relaxation times (DRT)

We know that there are existing tools and algorithms for these analyses.

EIS is already notoriously difficult to interpret. What if we gave an LLM access to these tools and have it orchestrate the analyses and intepret the results? Can it offer further insights?

Enter Impedance Agent - A Python package for automated impedance spectroscopy analysis.

This package uses an LLM workflow to automate the analysis of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy(EIS) data.

Impedance agent has access to three tools - A fit-linkk, fit-drt and fit-ecm tool. The agent runs these tools concurrently or sequentially

and uses the results from the analysis to provide insights about the quality of the data, the quality of the fit, and the likely underlying physical and electrochemical processes.

Whether you're analyzing fuel cells, batteries, corrosion systems, or any other electrochemical interface, this library offers a powerful and user-friendly approach to impedance analysis.

Should you choose to ignore the summary of the LLM, you still have the guarantee of a one-shot analysis.

### Sample Analysis Output

The following is an example of the analysis output generated by the tool:

#### Comprehensive Analysis of Impedance Data

**1. Path Following Analysis (ECM Fit)**
   - **Path Deviation**: 0.0587 (5.87% deviation)
   - **Rating**: Acceptable
   - **Implications**:
     - The model follows the experimental arc shape reasonably well.
     - The deviation is within the acceptable range (< 0.10), indicating the model structure is valid.
     - No immediate need to modify the model structure, but further refinement is possible.

**2. Vector Difference Analysis (ECM Fit)**
   - **Vector Difference**: 0.00155 (0.155% average deviation)
   - **Rating**: Excellent
   - **Implications**:
     - The fit closely matches the experimental data in both real and imaginary components.
     - The residuals are minimal, indicating a high-quality fit.

**3. Parameter Correlation Analysis**
   - **Strong Correlations**:
     - **Qh-nh**: Expected strong correlation (|r| = 0.986), typical for CPE parameters.
     - **Wad-Cad**: Strong correlation (|r| = 0.999), expected for diffusion-related parameters.
     - **Rint-Wint**: Strong correlation (|r| = 0.993), indicating a physical relationship between interfacial resistance and diffusion.
   - **Other Correlations**:
     - **Rs-Rp**: Strong correlation (|r| = 0.978), suggesting a possible overparameterization or redundant elements.
     - **Rad-Rint**: Moderate correlation (|r| = 0.151), no significant overparameterization.
   - **Implications**:
     - The strong Qh-nh and Wad-Cad correlations are expected and do not indicate overparameterization.
     - The Rs-Rp correlation suggests potential redundancy in the model. Consider simplifying the model by fixing or removing one of these parameters.

**4. DRT Analysis**
   - **Peak Frequencies**: 29.5 Hz, 123 Hz, 250 Hz, 1.58 kHz, 19.9 kHz, 125.6 kHz
   - **Peak Polarizations**: 0.123, 0.016, 0.137, 0.117, 0.095, 0.336
   - **Implications**:
     - The DRT reveals six distinct processes with characteristic time constants.
     - The highest polarization (0.336) at 125.6 kHz suggests a dominant high-frequency process, likely related to charge transfer or interfacial phenomena.
     - The lower-frequency peaks (29.5 Hz, 123 Hz, 250 Hz) may correspond to diffusion or bulk processes.
     - The DRT results align well with the ECM fit, validating the model structure.

**5. Lin-KK Analysis**
   - **Validation Metrics**:
     - **M**: 22
     - **μ**: 0.611
     - **Max Residual**: 0.00112

   - **Implications**:
     - The data satisfies the Kramers-Kronig relations, indicating high-quality measurements.
     - The residuals are minimal, confirming the validity of the experimental data.

**6. ECM Fit Metrics**
   - **Chi-Square**: 0.000133
   - **AIC**: -346.52
   - **WRMS**: 1.68e-06
   - **Implications**:
     - The low chi-square and AIC values indicate a high-quality fit.
     - The weighted root mean square (WRMS) is exceptionally low, further confirming the fit's accuracy.

**7. Residual Analysis**
   - **Real Residuals**: Range from -0.00069 to 0.00076
   - **Imaginary Residuals**: Range from -0.00042 to 0.00086
   - **Implications**:
     - Residuals are randomly distributed around zero, indicating no systematic errors.
     - The residuals are within acceptable limits, confirming the fit's reliability.

## Caveat

We know that LLMs are not perfect. They hallucinate. The summary provided by the LLM does not eliminate the need for a domain knowledge expert review.

The idea of this library is to provide insights meant to guide an expert analysis
